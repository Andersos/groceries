# Grocery shopping app

This project is for pure fun. No seriousness involved, just trying out new stuff - atm Babel and homegrown isomorphic refluxing.

## Get it running

Run webpack trickery in its own tab
```bash
$ npm run serve-webpack
```

Then start app + even more webpack
```bash
$ npm start
```
